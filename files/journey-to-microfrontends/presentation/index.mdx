# What are we solving?

---

- Independant teams working on their own features or apps
- These teams work in different environments
- How to integrate these?

    <li>Kanban, Scrum</li>
    <li>One-Off Apps vs long-running ones</li>
  </ul>
</Notes>

---

# Context

---

- Frontend platform with around 25 developers
- Frontend platform powers 12 (similar-looking) websites

---

- Three sub-teams with different methodologies
- We release once a week
- Other teams in the company (in-house and off-shore) want to integrate

<Notes>
  <ul>
    <li>Kanban, Scrum</li>
    <li>No CD due to regulatory environment</li>
  </ul>

---

- Header is coupled to application state
- Header might be slightly different on the website
- Footer is content-managed

---

## Terminology

---

_Host_

Frontend platform (where teams want or need to integrate into)

---

_Feature_

A feature that needs to be integrated, which could be visual, non-visual or both

---

# Conditions of success

---

- Host and feature can release independantly
- Technology choice integrates well into framework choice
- Errors won't break the host
- Potential to optimise host and feature apps

---

# iFrames

---

_Example_

- Games are loaded in an iFrame
- Options are being passed through as a query string
- iFrame communicates through `postMessage`

---

## 😀

- Technology agnostic

---

## 😧

- Hard to optimise for
- iFrame issues (Double scrollbars anyone?)

---

- ✅ Host and feature can release independantly
- ☑️ Technology choice integrates well into framework choice
- ✅ Errors won't break the host
- ❌ Potential to optimise host and feature apps

---

# Hook approach

---

- All teams gain access to the frontend platform codebase
- These teams hook into the internals of the codebase

---

## 😀

- Monkey-patching friendly

---

## 😧

- Strong coupling
- Maintainance overhead
- Hard to communicate changes
- Easy to introduce bloat

---

- ❌ Host and feature can release independantly
- ✅ Technology choice integrates well into framework choice
- ❌ Errors won't break the host
- ❌ Potential to optimise host and feature apps

---

# WebComponents

---

<Image name="webcomponent" />

---

## 😀

- Technology agnostic

---

## 😧

- Browser support (especially older mobile browser)
- Potential performance slowdowns
- Hard to optimise for
- Potential for leaking variables and errors

---

- ✅ Host and feature can release independantly
- ☑️ Technology choice integrates well into framework choice
- ❌ Errors won't break the host
- ☑️ Potential to optimise host and feature apps

---

# NPM Packages

---

- Semantic versioning
- Feature published to registry, host consumes package
- Defined contract

---

# 😀

- Separation of concerns
- Optimisation at build time by the host

---

# 😧

- Coupled to the hosts' release cycle
- Potential communucation overhead

---

- ❌ Host and feature can release independantly
- ✅ Technology choice integrates well into framework choice
- ☑️ Errors won't break the host
- ✅ Potential to optimise host and feature apps

---

# iFrames (again), kinda

---

[github.com/krakenjs/zoid](github.com/krakenjs/zoid)

---

## 😀

- Abstracts away some of the iFrame pain points
- Cross-domain support
- Technology agnostic

---

## 😧

- Hard to optimise for
- It's still iFrames under the hood

---

- ✅ Host and feature can release independantly
- ☑️ Technology choice integrates well into framework choice
- ✅ Errors won't break the host
- ❌ Potential to optimise host and feature apps

---

# Micro Frontends

---

- Features as its own JavaScript bundle
- Feature releases independantly
- Host loads bundle at bundle at runtime

---

## Loading at runtime

- Original inspiration: [unpkg.com](unpkg.com)
- `unpkg.com/react` resolves to `https://unpkg.com/react@16.9.0/index.js`
- `unpkg.com/react@15` resolves to `https://unpkg.com/react@15.6.2/react.js`

---

- Request bundle from URL
- Breaking change as part of the URL, like `website.com/mfes/mycoolfrontend/v1`
- Strict semantic versioning
- Request returns JavaScript that will be executed

---

- SystemJS as transport mechanism
- Module signature similar to AMD

```javascript
System.register('mymodule', ['react', 'react-dom'], function() {
  ...
})
```

---

## Things we are still figuring out

- Server side rendering
- How to best optimise the different bundles

---

- ✅ Host and feature can release independantly
- ☑️ Technology choice integrates well into framework choice
- ☑️ Errors won't break the host
- ☑️ Potential to optimise host and feature apps
